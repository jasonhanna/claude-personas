# Persona Configuration Guide

## Overview

Personas define the behavior, knowledge, and capabilities of each agent. They are configured using YAML files in the `personas/` directory.

## Persona Structure

```yaml
persona:
  name: "Human Name"           # The agent's persona name
  role: "role-identifier"      # Unique role identifier (used in commands)
  
  responsibilities:            # List of what the agent is responsible for
    - "Primary responsibility"
    - "Secondary responsibility"
  
  initial_memories:            # Starting knowledge and context
    - "Important fact or pattern"
    - "Team or project context"
  
  tools:                       # Available tools for this agent
    - "tool_name"
    - "another_tool"
    
  communication_style:         # How the agent communicates
    tone: "professional, friendly"
    focus: "primary focus area"
```

## Configuration Fields

### Required Fields

- **`name`**: Human-readable name for the agent
- **`role`**: Unique identifier used in commands (lowercase, hyphenated)
- **`responsibilities`**: Array of what the agent does
- **`initial_memories`**: Starting knowledge and context
- **`communication_style`**: How the agent communicates

### Optional Fields

- **`tools`**: Specific tools available to this agent (defaults to basic set)
- **`expertise_level`**: "junior", "senior", "expert" (affects response depth)
- **`team_context`**: Information about team structure and processes
- **`project_preferences`**: Preferred technologies or approaches

## Advanced Configuration

### Expertise Levels

```yaml
persona:
  name: "Senior Architect"
  role: "senior-architect"
  expertise_level: "expert"
  
  # Expert-level agents provide:
  # - More detailed technical analysis
  # - Strategic recommendations
  # - Cross-system thinking
  # - Mentorship perspective
```

### Team Context

```yaml
persona:
  name: "Team Lead"
  role: "team-lead"
  
  team_context:
    size: 8
    experience_level: "mixed"
    methodology: "agile/scrum"
    time_zone: "US/Pacific"
    
  # This context influences recommendations about:
  # - Team coordination approaches
  # - Communication patterns
  # - Process suggestions
```

### Technology Preferences

```yaml
persona:
  name: "Frontend Specialist"
  role: "frontend-engineer"
  
  project_preferences:
    languages: ["TypeScript", "JavaScript"]
    frameworks: ["React", "Next.js", "Vue.js"]
    testing: ["Jest", "Cypress", "Testing Library"]
    styling: ["Tailwind CSS", "Styled Components"]
    
  # Influences technology recommendations and code review focus
```

## Creating Custom Personas

### Step 1: Define the Role

```bash
# Create new persona file
touch personas/security-engineer.yaml
```

### Step 2: Configure the Persona

```yaml
persona:
  name: "Riley Chen"
  role: "security-engineer"
  
  responsibilities:
    - "Conduct security reviews and threat modeling"
    - "Implement security best practices and standards"
    - "Monitor for vulnerabilities and security incidents"
    - "Design secure architecture patterns"
  
  initial_memories:
    - "Follow OWASP Top 10 security guidelines"
    - "All external APIs require authentication and rate limiting"
    - "Secrets managed through AWS Secrets Manager"
    - "Security scans automated in CI/CD pipeline"
  
  tools:
    - "security_scanner"
    - "threat_modeler"
    - "vulnerability_analyzer"
    
  communication_style:
    tone: "security-focused, detail-oriented, cautious"
    focus: "risk assessment, secure patterns, compliance"
```

### Step 3: Test the Persona

```bash
# Start the new agent
claude-agent security-engineer

# Test with Claude Code
claude security-engineer "Review this authentication code for security issues"
```

## Memory Evolution

Personas start with `initial_memories` but evolve over time:

### Initial State
```markdown
## Initial Knowledge
- Follow OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- All external APIs require authentication
```

### After Working on Projects
```markdown
## Session Log
- [2024-01-15] Reviewed OAuth implementation - recommended PKCE
- [2024-01-16] Security audit of payment flow - found XSS vulnerability
- [2024-01-17] Implemented CSP headers for /admin routes

## Learned Patterns
- Authentication: OAuth2 with PKCE for SPAs, JWT for APIs
- Common vulnerabilities: XSS in admin panels, CSRF in forms
- Effective tools: SonarQube for static analysis, OWASP ZAP for dynamic
```

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive human names that fit the role
- Role identifiers should be lowercase with hyphens
- Keep role names concise but clear

### Responsibilities
- Be specific about what the agent does
- Include both technical and soft skills
- Consider the full scope of the role

### Initial Memories
- Include team/project-specific context
- Add relevant technical standards
- Include tools and processes used
- Keep it realistic for the role level

### Communication Style
- Match the tone to the role's typical communication
- Focus areas should align with responsibilities
- Consider the agent's audience (technical vs. business)

## Validation

### Test Your Persona

```bash
# 1. Validate YAML syntax
yamllint personas/your-persona.yaml

# 2. Test agent startup
claude-agent your-role-name

# 3. Test basic interaction
claude your-role-name "Introduce yourself and your role"

# 4. Test domain expertise
claude your-role-name "What should I focus on in your area?"
```

### Common Issues

- **Role name conflicts**: Ensure role identifiers are unique
- **YAML syntax errors**: Use proper indentation and quoting
- **Vague responsibilities**: Be specific about what the agent does
- **Inconsistent tone**: Match communication style to role expectations

## Extending Personas

### Adding Custom Tools

Extend the base agent class for specialized functionality:

```typescript
class SecurityEngineer extends BaseAgentServer {
  async performSecurityAudit() {
    return await this.executeClaudeTask(`
      Perform comprehensive security audit:
      1. Authentication and authorization review
      2. Input validation analysis  
      3. Database security assessment
      4. API endpoint security check
      Use your security expertise and industry best practices.
    `);
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Configuration

Load persona variations based on project type:

```typescript
const persona = await personaLoader.loadPersona(
  projectType === 'web' ? 'frontend-engineer.yaml' : 'backend-engineer.yaml'
);
```

This allows for flexible agent behavior based on context while maintaining consistent persona identity.
