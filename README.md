# üé≠ Claude Code Personas

> Ship better products with AI personas that act like your most valuded team members

Get design reviews from an Engineering Manager, strategic insights from a Product Manager, and comprehensive QA analysis using simple prompts. Personas create virtuous feedback loops that bring diverse perspectives to your work. No servers to manage, no complex setup. Just type, ask, and ship better code.

## ‚ú® What This Does

This project provides **ready-to-use AI personas** that easily integrate with Claude Code and its built-in memory import system. Each persona brings specialized knowledge and perspective to your development projects.

### üéØ Starter Personas

- **üìê Alex, Engineering Manager** - Technical architecture, code quality, best practices
- **üí° Sarah, Product Manager** - Requirements analysis, user stories, feature prioritization  
- **üìã Marcus, QA Manager** - Testing strategies, quality assurance, bug prevention

### üí¨ How to Use

Once installed, simply ask any persona for help:

```bash
claude "Ask the engineering manager to review this API design"
claude "Ask Sarah to help prioritize these features"
claude "Ask the QA manager to design a comprehensive test plan"
```

Claude Code automatically loads the persona's expertise and provides specialized guidance based on their role and experience.

### Adding Project-Specific Context

**Why This Matters**: Generic personas provide general guidance, but personas with your project's specific context give targeted, actionable advice that considers your actual architecture, tech stack, and constraints.

#### The Power of Project Context

When personas understand your project details, they can:
- **Give relevant architecture advice** based on your actual tech stack
- **Suggest realistic testing strategies** for your specific frameworks  
- **Prioritize features** considering your actual user base and business model
- **Identify real risks** in your codebase rather than theoretical ones

#### How to Add Project Context

1. **Let Claude Code analyze your codebase** to generate project-specific context:

```bash
claude "Analyze this codebase and generate a project context section for an Engineering Manager persona. Include: tech stack, architecture patterns, testing approach, key challenges, performance requirements, and security considerations. Format it as markdown that I can add to the persona file."
```

2. **For Product Manager context**, try:

```bash
claude "Analyze this project and create a Product Manager context section including: user personas, business model, key pain points, competitive advantages, success metrics, and release process. Make it specific to this codebase."
```

3. **For QA Manager context**:

```bash
claude "Review this codebase and generate a QA context section covering: current test coverage, testing frameworks used, test environments, key areas to test, performance requirements, and what's missing from our quality strategy."
```

#### Where to Add Context

Add the generated context to your persona files under the **"My Current Context"** section:

```markdown
## My Current Context

### All Projects
- [General standards that apply to all your work]

### Your Project Name
- **Tech Stack**: [Your specific technologies]
- **Architecture**: [Your specific patterns]
- **Testing**: [Your specific approach]
- **Key Challenges**: [Your actual challenges]
- **Performance**: [Your actual requirements]
- **Security**: [Your specific considerations]
```

#### Example in Action

**Before**: "Review this API design for best practices"
**After**: "Review this Express.js API design considering our MongoDB Atlas setup, Auth0 integration, and requirement to handle 1000 concurrent users"

The persona now knows your specific context and gives targeted advice!

### Create Custom Personas

You can create your own personas for any role you need! Simply add new `.md` files to `~/.claude-agents/personas/` and they'll be automatically discovered.

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Create the persona file**
```bash
# Create a new persona file
touch ~/.claude-agents/personas/security-engineer.md
```

2. **Follow the persona format** (see template below)

3. **Update your memory imports**
```bash
npm run update-personas  # Adds new persona to your User memory
```

4. **Start using your new persona**
```bash
claude "Ask the security engineer to review this authentication flow"
```

#### Persona Template

Create personas following this proven format:

```markdown

## My Decision Framework
When evaluating security concerns, I consider:
1. **Risk Assessment**: What's the potential impact and likelihood?
2. **Defense in Depth**: How can we layer multiple protections?
3. **Developer Experience**: How can we make security easy to do right?
4. **Compliance**: What regulatory requirements apply?
5. **Cost vs Risk**: What's the appropriate level of protection?
```

#### New Persona Ideas

Here are some additional personas you might consider creating:

**üë®‚Äçüíª DevOps Engineer** - Infrastructure, deployment, monitoring
```bash
# Create with: touch ~/.claude-agents/personas/devops-engineer.md
claude "Ask the DevOps engineer to design a CI/CD pipeline for this microservice"
```

**üé® UX Designer** - User experience, interface design, usability
```bash
# Create with: touch ~/.claude-agents/personas/ux-designer.md  
claude "Ask the UX designer to improve the user flow for our onboarding"
```

**üìä Data Scientist** - Analytics, ML/AI, data insights
```bash
# Create with: touch ~/.claude-agents/personas/data-scientist.md
claude "Ask the data scientist to recommend metrics for this feature"
```

**üèóÔ∏è Solutions Architect** - System design, scalability, integrations
```bash

```bash
# Create with: touch ~/.claude-agents/personas/compliance-officer.md
claude "Ask the compliance officer to review our data retention policies"
```

#### Best Practices for Customizing Personas

**‚úÖ Do:**
- Give personas specific expertise areas and years of experience
- Include their decision-making frameworks and methodologies
- Add relevant technical context for your industry/domain
- Define clear communication style and tone
- Include project memories section for context building

**‚ùå Avoid:**
- Generic or overly broad expertise claims
- Conflicting responsibilities between personas
- Too many personas (start with 3-5 core roles)
- Copying existing persona content without customization
