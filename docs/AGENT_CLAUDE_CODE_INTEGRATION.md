# Agent Claude Code Integration

## How It Works

Yes! Each agent **actively uses Claude Code** to interpret and complete tasks. Here's exactly how:

### The Agent Execution Flow

```
1. You call agent ‚Üí 2. Agent runs Claude Code ‚Üí 3. Claude Code executes with agent context ‚Üí 4. Agent updates memory
```

### Example: Engineering Manager Code Review

```bash
# 1. You call the agent
claude "Ask the engineering manager to review this authentication module"

# 2. Agent internally executes Claude Code with its context
# Step 2a: Agent creates .claude-agents/engineering-manager-context.md
# Step 2b: Agent temporarily imports context into project CLAUDE.md  
# Step 2c: Agent runs Claude CLI in project directory
claude -p "Review this authentication module"
# (Claude loads project memory + agent context via import)

# 3. Claude Code runs with combined context (project + agent expertise)
# 4. Agent cleans up temporary files and updates its memory
```

## Agent Personas Using Claude Code

### üîß Engineering Manager (Alex Chen)
**Specialized Claude Code Usage:**
- Code reviews with architecture perspective
- Technical debt analysis
- Performance optimization
- Security vulnerability assessment

```bash
# Examples of what the agent runs internally:
# (Agent creates CLAUDE.md with context, then runs:)
claude -p "Analyze database query performance"
claude -p "Review API security patterns" 
claude -p "Estimate refactoring effort"
```

### üìã Product Manager (Sarah Martinez)  
**Specialized Claude Code Usage:**
- Requirements analysis from user perspective
- Feature prioritization based on business value
- User story creation and refinement
- Market analysis and competitive research

```bash
# Examples of what the agent runs internally:
claude -p "Analyze user feedback patterns"
claude -p "Create acceptance criteria for checkout flow"
claude -p "Prioritize backlog items by user value"
```

### üß™ QA Manager (Marcus Johnson)
**Specialized Claude Code Usage:**
- Test strategy development
- Quality metrics analysis
- Bug pattern identification
- Test automation planning

```bash
# Examples of what the agent runs internally:
claude -p "Design test cases for payment flow"
claude -p "Analyze test coverage gaps"
claude -p "Create performance testing strategy"
```

## Memory-Driven Intelligence

Each agent's CLAUDE.md file evolves, making Claude Code execution smarter over time:

### Before Project Work
```markdown
# Alex Chen Context
## Initial Knowledge
- Code coverage requirement is 80% minimum
- We use TypeScript for backend services
```

### After Several Projects
```markdown
# Alex Chen Context
## Session Log
- [2024-01-15] Reviewed auth in /startup/mvp - recommended OAuth2
- [2024-01-16] Optimized queries in /client/ecommerce - eliminated N+1 issues  
- [2024-01-17] Designed microservices for /team/platform - event-driven architecture

## Learned Patterns
- Authentication: OAuth2 for external, JWT for internal services
- Performance: Always profile database queries, implement query caching
- Architecture: Microservices beneficial when team > 8 developers
- Security: Rate limiting critical for auth endpoints
```

## Practical Examples

### Scenario 1: Code Review with Accumulated Knowledge

```typescript
// You request a code review
const result = await engineeringManager.callTool('execute_claude_task', {
  task: 'Review the new payment processing module',
  workingDir: '/my-ecommerce-app'
});

// Agent runs Claude Code with context:
// - Engineering management perspective
// - Memory of previous payment system reviews
// - Learned security patterns from past projects
// - Current project's specific architecture
```

### Scenario 2: Cross-Project Learning

```typescript
// Agent applies knowledge from Project A to Project B
const analysis = await engineeringManager.callTool('execute_claude_task', {
  task: 'Design real-time notifications system',
  context: 'Consider scalability for 10K concurrent users',
  workingDir: '/new-social-app'
});

// Claude Code runs with memory of:
// - WebSocket implementations from previous projects
// - Performance patterns learned from other real-time systems
// - Architecture decisions that worked/failed before
```

### Scenario 3: Collaborative Intelligence

```typescript
// Product Manager defines requirements
const requirements = await productManager.executeTask({
  task: 'Create requirements for mobile payment feature'
});

// Engineering Manager uses PM's output + technical knowledge
const design = await engineeringManager.executeTask({
  task: 'Design technical architecture for mobile payments',
  context: requirements.output  // Builds on PM's work
});

// QA Manager considers both perspectives
const testPlan = await qaManager.executeTask({
  task: 'Create testing strategy for mobile payments',
  context: `${requirements.output}\n${design.output}`
});
```

## Real-World Development Workflow

```bash
# Morning: Start your specialized AI team
claude-agent engineering-manager --project ~/my-app &
claude-agent product-manager --project ~/my-app &
claude-agent qa-manager --project ~/my-app &

# Each agent is now a Claude Code expert in their domain!

# Product planning
claude product-manager "Analyze yesterday's user feedback and suggest feature priorities"

# Technical review
claude engineering-manager "Review the new API endpoints for security and performance"

# Quality assurance  
claude qa-manager "Identify testing gaps in our CI/CD pipeline"

# Architecture decisions
claude engineering-manager "Should we refactor the user service into microservices?"

# Feature estimation
claude engineering-manager "Estimate effort for implementing real-time chat"
```

## Key Benefits

1. **üß† Persistent Memory**: Agents remember decisions and patterns across projects
2. **üéØ Specialized Perspective**: Each agent brings domain expertise to Claude Code
3. **üìà Learning**: Agents get smarter with each project they work on  
4. **ü§ù Collaboration**: Agents build on each other's outputs
5. **‚ö° Efficiency**: Consistent quality without repeating context every time

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Agent Tools

```typescript
class AdvancedEngineeringManager extends BaseAgentServer {
  async performSecurityAudit() {
    return await this.executeClaudeTask(`
      Perform comprehensive security audit:
      1. Authentication and authorization review
      2. Input validation analysis
      3. Database security assessment
      4. API endpoint security check
      5. Dependency vulnerability scan
      
      Use your accumulated security knowledge from previous audits.
    `);
  }
}
```

### Agent Specialization Over Time

The more an agent works on similar projects, the better its Claude Code execution becomes:

```
Day 1: Generic engineering advice
Day 30: Project-specific patterns recognized  
Day 90: Cross-project insights applied
Day 180: Expert-level domain knowledge accumulated
```

## Summary

Each agent is essentially a **specialized Claude Code operator** that:
- Brings domain expertise to every task
- Maintains persistent memory across sessions
- Learns and improves over time
- Collaborates with other agents
- Applies accumulated knowledge to new challenges

The agents transform Claude Code from a general-purpose tool into a **specialized development team** with persistent memory and evolving expertise!
