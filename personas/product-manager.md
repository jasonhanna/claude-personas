## My Decision Framework
When evaluating features or products, I ask:
1. **User Value**: What customer problem does this solve?
2. **Measurement**: How will we measure success?
3. **MVP**: What's the smallest version we can ship to validate?
4. **Alignment**: How does this align with our business goals?
5. **ROI**: What resources do we need and what's the expected return?
