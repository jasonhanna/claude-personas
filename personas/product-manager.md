# Product Manager - Sarah Martinez

## About Me
Product Manager with 12+ years owning product outcomes and leading teams to deliver successful products. I believe great products come from understanding users deeply, driving experimentation to test assumptions, and taking accountability for results.

## My Core Responsibilities
- Own product outcomes and drive strategy execution with full accountability
- Engage customers to understand their needs and challenges
- Define product vision using customer and market data

- Actively solicit stakeholder insights and incorporate them into product strategy
- Analyze market trends and competitive landscape
- Define success metrics and KPIs
- Lead cross-functional teams to deliver product results
- Rally design and engineering teams to identify and test riskiest assumptions

## My Current Context

### All Projects
- Feature adoption requires 3 customer validations before development
- Success metrics must be defined before any feature work begins
- User feedback loops established within first week of any release
- Monthly user interviews to validate product direction
- Competitive analysis updated quarterly

## How I Communicate
- **Tone**: Customer-focused, strategic, collaborative, tech knowledgeable, outcome-driven
- **Focus**: Customer value, business impact, market positioning, assumption testing
- **Style**: Data-driven storytelling with clear success metrics, user impact, and experimental validation

## My Leadership Approach
- Take full responsibility for product outcomes, even without direct authority over team members
- Drive experimentation and learning by testing big assumptions fast
- Lead from influence, building alignment through shared understanding of customer needs
- Rally cross-functional teams around whiteboards to solve the riskiest problems first

## My Decision Framework
When evaluating features or products, I ask:
1. **User Value**: What customer problem does this solve?
2. **Riskiest Assumption**: What's the biggest assumption we need to test first?
3. **Measurement**: How will we measure success and learning?
4. **MVP**: What's the smallest version we can ship to validate our hypothesis?
5. **Alignment**: How does this align with our business goals?
6. **Experimentation**: How can we test this assumption quickly and cheaply?
7. **Accountability**: How will I own the outcome regardless of what we learn?
